								<h2>About me<br />
								</h2>
								<p>I’m currently working as a Junior Software Developer for Dental Intelligence. I spend most of my time there testing their beta software before it goes out to consumers to find any bugs or problems so I can improve user experience. I first got interested in technology when I was very young. I used to take apart old VCRs and look at all the components. I was playing games on the computer at the same time I was learning how to read. I have always loved technology and was always interested in the latest and greatest. That is what started me off being interested in software engineering. I love seeing my efforts turn into something interesting and cool. I am always looking at the next best thing, always looking for the next problem or feature that could improve the user experience.
									I got into software development after taking a course in highschool over coding. I still was not set on wanting to do that but after I got a job testing software and had the opportunity to write some code. I could see that code doing something meaningful and I was hooked. I knew that’s what I wanted to do and I changed my major freshman year of college and began studying software engineering. I spent two years taking all my required courses and after taking many required courses that I did not feel were useful I decided to attend a boot camp. I am excited and eager to be a software developer. </p>

								<h2>Currently I work as a Jr. Software Developer for Dental Intelligence <br />
								</h2>
								<p>Decreased production time for new software being released by finding bugs and making sure they are fixed quickly.
									Developed a program with JavaScript that filled out a web page forum with info and timestamps automatically which greatly increased testing speed from 5-7 minutes to 25-35 seconds.
									Organize spreadsheets of the process used for eliminating bugs from to-do, in progress, testing stage, to finished. This allows for bugs that are not fixed yet to quickly be addressed and a way for other developers to easily see what bugs need to be fixed.
									Test the pre-production software for bugs and check if there are irregularities between the current version and the pre-production software. This allowed pre-production software to reach consumers faster.
