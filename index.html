								<h2>About me<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Iâ€™m currently working as a QA Engineer Developer for Dental Intelligence. I spend most of my time there testing tickets before a release to minimize the amount of bugs getting into production. The rest of my time there is spent writing automated test using Cypress and Playwright.
								</p>
								<p>			
									I first got interested in technology when I was very young, I used to take apart old VCRs and look at all the components. I was playing games on the computer at the same time I was learning how to read. I have always loved technology and was always interested in the latest and greatest. That is what started me off being interested in software engineering. I love seeing my efforts turn into something interesting and cool. I am always looking at the next best thing, always looking for the next problem or feature that could improve the user experience.
								</p>
								<p>
									I got into software development after taking a course in highschool over coding. I could see that code doing something meaningful and I was hooked. I knew that is what I wanted to do and I changed my major freshman year of college and began studying software engineering. I spent two years taking all my required courses and after taking many required courses that I did not feel were useful I decided to attend a boot camp. I love getting to write new code and create interesting things. </p>

								<h2>Currently I work as a QA Engineer Developer for Dental Intelligence <br />
								</h2>
								<p>Decreased production time for new software being released by finding bugs and making sure they are fixed quickly.
									Developed a program with JavaScript that filled out a web page forum with info and timestamps automatically which greatly increased testing speed from 5-7 minutes to 25-35 seconds.
									Organize spreadsheets of the process used for eliminating bugs from to-do, in progress, testing stage, to finished. This allows for bugs that are not fixed yet to quickly be addressed and a way for other developers to easily see what bugs need to be fixed.
									Test the pre-production software for bugs and check if there are irregularities between the current version and the pre-production software. This allowed pre-production software to reach consumers faster.

								<p>I love traveling, going new places and learning new things. My wife and I love traveling together and trying new restaurants. I also enjoy the outdoors, swimming, hiking, fishing. I spend a lot of time indoors for my job so when I get the chance I like to get out of the house.</p>
