            <h3>Actualize Bootcamp Capstone Project</h3>
            <p>
              I took a full-stack coding bootcamp for about 5 months in 2020. It was online based and I took it during
              the evenings because I had work. I learned Ruby on Rails on the backend and Vue.js on the frontend. The
              last month or so of the bootcamp we were tasked to create a website from scratch. Frontend and backend was
              written by me. I have an interest in cars and decided to make a car auction website where you could view a
              list of cars on the main page and click on different cars, make bids, comments etc. The website also
              connected to an external API that used the VIN of the car to get current auction values and a plethora of
              other information. This is a link to a Youtube video where I presented this project.

              I Decreased production time for new software being released by finding bugs and making sure they are fixed
              quickly. Developed a program with JavaScript that filled out a web page forum with info and timestamps
              automatically which greatly increased testing speed from 5-7 minutes to 25-35 seconds. Organize
              spreadsheets of the process used for eliminating bugs from to-do, in progress, testing stage, to finished.
              This allows for bugs that are not fixed yet to quickly be addressed and a way for other developers to
              easily see what bugs need to be fixed. Test the pre-production software for bugs and check if there are
              irregularities between the current version and the pre-production software. This allowed pre-production
              software to reach consumers faster.

              Ever so often I have an idea for something I can code that inspires me to get to work. I don't have any
              big impressive projects to talk about here but just a couple things I decided to do just for fun.
