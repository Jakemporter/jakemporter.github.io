            <h3>Actualize Bootcamp Capstone Project</h3>
            <p>
              I took a full-stack coding bootcamp for about 5 months in 2020. It was online based and I took it during
              the evenings because I had work. I learned Ruby on Rails on the backend and Vue.js on the frontend. The
              last month or so of the bootcamp we were tasked to create a website from scratch. Frontend and backend was
              written by me. I have an interest in cars and decided to make a car auction website where you could view a
              list of cars on the main page and click on different cars, make bids, comments etc. The website also
              connected to an external API that used the VIN of the car to get current auction values and a plethora of
              other information. This is a link to a Youtube video where I presented this project.

            <p>
              My job at Dental Intelligence consist partly of testing a variety of bugs and tickets after a sprint but
              before they get released. The goal is to reduce the amount of bugs that go into production and are seen by
              customers. My favorite part of my job though consist of making automatted test. For the last couple years
              I was making tests using javascript in cypress. More recently I have been using typescript on a new
              testing platform called Playwright.

              <h5>
                Ever so often I have an idea for something I can code that inspires me to get to work. I don't have any
                big impressive projects to talk about here but just a couple things I decided to do just for fun.
              </h5>
              <h6>Password Generator</h6>
              <p>
                As I've gotten older It's become more apparent to me how important security is on the internet,
                particulary when it involves passwords. I decided I wanted to create a password generator that I knew
                was truly random. Here it is if you want to check it out:

                <br />
                Also if you want to take a look at how long it would take to crack some of your passwords check these
                out:
